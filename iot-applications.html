            <h2 class="head-2">IoT Apps</h2>
            <p class="content">IoT application refers to any kind of system or environment which consists of a number of
                devices, services and/or sensors. The application is said to be an Internet of Things applicaion if it
                is connected
                to the Internet and works in real-time. It should be stable, secure and the integration of devices
                should
                be smooth. For instance Agricultural Drones and fitness trackers are some devices which uses IoT
                technology. </p>

            <h2 class="head-2">Smart Building</h2>
            <p class="content">A building can be termed as Smart if it's various processes and systems are automated or made efficient
                with the help of Internet Of Things applications. This concept can be better explained with the
                help of some expample senerios. To begin with, automated doors can be installed to make the entry/exit
                easy for disables people. After this, Motion Sensors can be installed on the water taps to save
                unnecessary water wastage. A lot of similar systems can be installed throughout the building to
                convert it into a Smart Building.</p>

            <h2 class="head-2">Control Interface</h2>
            <p class="content">These are the web-based interfaces which are connected to various types of system with the help of
                internet and cloud to control any system in real-time. For example, the HVAC system (Heating,
                Ventilation,
                and Air Conditioning) can be controlled by the respective authorities of the building with the help of
                its Control
                Interface. </p>
